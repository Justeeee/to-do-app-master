# Create TODO list Using Django And Python


## Pre-Requisites
- Python 3.9
- Pip
- Git

## Steps to run:

- In PipFile, the dependencies are mentioned. It is recommended to run the app inside a virtual environment to avoid conflict of existing dependencies.
  - Create virtualenv for Python 3.9

  - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  - Run `./manage.py runserver` to start the server

  - Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to start
